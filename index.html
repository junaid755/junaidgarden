		<div class="titlecard"><h1> Aloe Vera</h1></div>
		<img class="box size"src  ="img/plant1.jpg">
		<p class="side"> Even for those who aren’t all that into herbal medicines or house plants, aloe vera is one that is recognizable, and most people are aware that it is great for burns. Aloe vera, though, has many medicinal uses beyond that. And, as for taking care of a houseplant, they don’t require much attention at all, are easy to find, and are cheap to buy as mature plants.

		<div class="titlecard"><h1> Hibiscus</h1></div>
		<img class="box1 size"src  ="img/plant3.jpg">
		<p class="side">Hibiscus are deciduous shrubs with dark green leaves; the plants can grow to 15 feet tall in frost-free areas. Flowers may be up to 6 inches diameter, with colors ranging from yellow to peach to red. Hibiscus can be planted singly or grown as a hedge plant; they can also be pruned into a single-stemmed small tree. The flowers are attractive to butterflies and hummingbirds.

	<div class="test">
		<div class="titlecard"><h1> Monstera Swiss Cheese Plant</h1></div>
		<img class="box1 size"src  ="img/plant4.jpg">
		<p class="side">The Swiss cheese plant displays the most interesting looking leaves and needs a grower to be prepared to provide some extra space within a home (it grows fairly tall when it matures).This climbing shrub is an ideal plant for a conservatory or large rooms, including a hotel or restaurant foyer.The holes and cuts within the leaves are said to form so the plant survives well within it's natural rain forest habitat when strong winds and heavy downpours (I mean very heavy) appear. Leaves without these cuts and holes would get broken easily because of their size and the force of the weather conditions.</p>
